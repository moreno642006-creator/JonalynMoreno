        <h1>GROWTH AND YIELD PERFORMANCE OF DIFFERENT LOWLAND RICE VARIETIES GROWN UNDER MIGARA, CALBAYOG CONDITION</h1>
        <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
        <H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
        <H4>Nature and importance of the study</H4>cdfd
        <P>Rice (oryza sativa linn.) has been grown for its varied uses. over 96% of the word rice crop is used for human food (McGraw-Hill, 1968). the rice brand is an exellent source of a major ingredient in manufacturing food products such as puff rice, flakes and native delicacies. Moreover, rice by product are  used as ingredient for animals feeds and pet food, edible oil, cooking and other products (Lesam, 1991) </P>
        <p>Generally rice is cultivated in the philippines under lowland and upland conditioins. there are 3.5 million hectar of farmland devoted rice production. of these total land area, 1.1 million hectares are cultivated to wet season  irrigation rice, 0.6 million hectares for rain fed, and 0.4 million hectares for uypland rice culture (IRRI, 1992)</p>
        <P>most lowland areas in the country are already under vrice cultivation and many researches are concentrated on lowland rice cultivation. Many improvements on cultural management practices have been done on lowland rice to increase production however it was just recently varietal improvement was studied since this play a major role in the total producton of rice(Giason, et, al. 1979)</P>
        <p>The tremendous advances in genetics, plan breeding and other closely related fields of discipline have radically changed the concept of cultivaras improvement of the different species of crops, which includes rice. Research studies have been done to find out the high yielding and goos quality of rice variety possessing desired agronomic characteristics such as resistace to pests and diseases and adaptable to soil (IRRI, 1992). </p>
        <P>Sales (1996) said that productivity has always considered as a key measures of performance in any agricultural system. Since the agricultural system plays a very vitaql role in the economic must be increased in order to support the level of consumption of the growing population. One of the problem in our country and posses a great challenge involved in research is to generate appropriate technologies all over the country, as well as in extension activities. </P>
        <p>It is not enough that the farmers know the art of  cultivating the crops. They must also know the proper actual practices to increase rice production. That is why rice production is already givem much importance these days, infact, it has received the top supportb of the government because the supply of rice as a staple food now a days cannot meet the needs of the countries population (IRRI, 1985). Thus, to ,meet the demand for increase rice production there is need to boost its production by maintaning the proper management of growing rice.</p>
        <p> This study was conducted in order to generate information on the performance oif different lowland rice varieties planted under Migara calbayog conditon.</p>

        <h4> Objective of the study</h4>

        <p>1. To evaluate the growth and yield performance of there different lowland rice varieties (PSB Rc18, NSIC Rc112).</p>
        <p>2. To compare the cost and return analysis of growing different lowland rice varieties;and</p>
        <p>3. To determine what specific variety that would gave high yeild.</p>

        <h4>Scope and limitation</h4>

        <p> This study focused oin the growth and yeild performance of the these different lowland rice varieties grown under migara, calbayog city conditon. The different varieties that were used where as follows: PSB Rc18, NSIC Rc110, NSIC Rc112. </p>

        <h4>Time and place of the study</h4>

        <p>This study was conducted at Brgy. Migara, Calbayog City from September 3, 2005 to January 4,2006.</p>

               <h2>Exercises Reflection</h2> 
             this exercise showed me that the very first step in making a webpage is understanding that headings and Paragraphs are the most imporetant tools. they're what give the page its skeleton and its meaning. i use them because they make the website easy to read for readers, but just as importantly, they help programs like google and screen readers figure out what my page is actually about so everyone can find it and use it.
