        Here comes a wave meant to wash me away
        A tide that is taking me under
        Swallowing sand, left with nothing to say
        My voice drowned out in the thunder

        But I won't cry
        And I won't start to crumble
        Whenever they try
        To shut me or cut me down

        I won't be silenced
        You can't keep me quiet
        Won't tremble when you try it
        All I know is I won't go speechless

        'Cause I'll breathe
        When they try to suffocate me
        Don't you underestimate me
       'Cause I know that I won't go speechless

       Written in stone, every rule, every word
       Centuries old and unbending
       Stay in your place, better seen and not heard
       But now that story is ending

       'Cause I
       I cannot start to crumble
       So come on and try
       Try to shut me and cut me down

       I won't be silenced
       You can't keep me quiet
       Won't tremble when you try it
       All I know is I won't go speechless
       Speechless

       Let the storm in
       I cannot be broken
       No, I won't live unspoken
       'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
  
       Try to lock me in this cage
       I won't just lay me down and die
       I will take these broken wings
       And watch me burn across the sky
       Hear the echoes saying I

       Won't be silenced
       Though you want to see me tremble when you try it
       All I know is I won't go speechless
       Speechless

       'Cause I'll breathe
       When they try to suffocate me
       Don't you underestimate me
       'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
       All I know is I won't go speechless
       Speechless

                <h2>Exercises Reflection</h2>
                i learned was how to use the code to actually put a picture or video on the screen. this is important because a picture is way faster and easier to understand than a long paragraph of text. adding lists was also crucial because they help me organize messy facts os steps one by one, instead of letting run together.
